## Notice
- Before you use the tools, don't forget to edit and disable the encryptxh1.py and decryptxh1.py update checker below each file! (Why this is enabled? - To inform you to each update or release from the github repository)
- Don't update immediately the tool if thers is a new update this may cause an error in the encryption process, decrypt fist to the version you used in the encryption process!
- Don't lost your "filename.xh1" file because we don't give a backup to each encrypted file!
- Don't edit the encryted file it may couse a error or corrupted error that can't read in encryption process!
- You can rename your file after the encryption process but make sure that have ".xh1" extention.
- You can modify or copy and apply to your code and projects you wish. Its free to use!
